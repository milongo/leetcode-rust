# LeetCode Solutions in Rust

This repository contains solutions to LeetCode problems implemented in Rust. The primary goal of this repository is to keep track of my Rust coding journey.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is twofold:
1. **Learning Rust:** Gain proficiency in Rust programming language by implementing solutions to algorithmic problems from LeetCode.
2. **Problem Solving:** Enhance problem-solving skills by tackling LeetCode's collection of algorithm and data structure challenges.

## Contents

- Solutions are implemented in Rust and are named according to the problem's title on LeetCode.
- Basic tests for each solution are implemented as a way to verify the solution.
